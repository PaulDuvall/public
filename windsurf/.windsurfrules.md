# Detailed Implementation Prompts (`<project_root>.windsurfrules.md`)

## 1. Example Architecture: AWS Infrastructure Automation for a Static Site

### 1.1 Provisioning AWS Resources
- **Objective:** Automate the provisioning of AWS resources to serve a static "Hello World" HTML file.
- **Directory Structure:**  
  Place all relevant files (CloudFormation template, static HTML file, and supporting scripts) within a dedicated directory.

### 1.2 Bash Script for CloudFormation Deployment
- **Objective:** Write a bash script that:
  - **Triggers the CloudFormation template to provision:**
    - **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager):** Set up a certificate for HTTPS.
    - **Route 53:** Configure the domain name by specifying an existing domain/hosted zone.
    - **CloudFront:** Deploy a CDN distribution in front of the S3 bucket, including cache invalidation steps.
    - **S3:** Create an S3 bucket to host the HTML file with a policy that allows public read access.
  - **Includes:**
    - A static `index.html` file with a "Hello World" message for initial testing.
    - Detailed inline documentation explaining:
      - How each service is configured.
      - How they interconnect.
      - How users can specify the domain/hosted zone.
  - **AWS Role Variable:**  
    Reference the variable from:
    ```

    AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME
    ```
