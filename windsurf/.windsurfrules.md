## 3. Detailed Implementation Prompts (` .windsurfrules.md`)

### 3.1. Example Architecture: AWS Infrastructure Automation for a Static Site

- **Provisioning AWS Resources:**
  - Automate the provisioning of AWS resources to serve a static "Hello World" HTML file.
  - **Directory Structure:**  
    Place all relevant files (CloudFormation template, static HTML file, and supporting scripts) within a dedicated directory.

- **Bash Script for CloudFormation Deployment:**
  - Write a bash script that:
    - Triggers the CloudFormation template to provision:
      - **ACM (AWS Certificate Manager):** Set up a certificate for HTTPS.
      - **Route 53:** Configure the domain name by specifying an existing domain/hosted zone.
      - **CloudFront:** Deploy a CDN distribution in front of the S3 bucket, including cache invalidation steps.
      - **S3:** Create an S3 bucket to host the HTML file with a policy that allows public read access.
    - Include a static `index.html` file with a "Hello World" message for initial testing.
    - Provide detailed inline documentation explaining how each service is configured, how they interconnect, and how users can specify the domain/hosted zone.
    - **AWS Role Variable:**  
      Reference the variable from:
      ```
      https://github.com/<username>/<repo>/settings/variables/actions
      AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME
      ```
